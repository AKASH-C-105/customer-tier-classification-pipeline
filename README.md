# Customer Tier Classification Pipeline

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an **end-to-end data pipeline** for analyzing customer data and preparing it for **customer tier classification**.

The workflow includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data cleaning**, **feature preprocessing**, and a **reusable pipeline** designed for scalability and future machine learning integration.
